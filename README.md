# COSMOS-2018 Cluster 6: Computer Networking and Robotics
This is meant to be a reference for everything completed in Cluster 6: Computer Networking and Robotics from the UCSC Campus of California State Summer School for Mathematics & Science (COSMOS) during the summer of 2018. The code reflects what is taught in the robotics section of the cluster, so the projects are written in C and designed for embedded systems using the MIPS architecture.
